# CCHAT
Message-Passing

Simple text-based messaging system called CCHAT. CCHAT is very much inspired by IRC, an old but still valid standard designed for group discussions.
For simplicity, my implementation of CCHAT is not going to use IRC’s protocol or low-level TCP/IP communication.
Instead, it will leverage Erlang’s processes and message passing features.
